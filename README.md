# BCG X Data Science Virtual Experience – Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains my work from the BCG X Data Science job simulation hosted on Forage. In this experience, I took on the role of a data scientist at BCG X to help PowerCo investigate customer churn and uncover actionable insights.

## 📊 Project Overview

PowerCo suspects price sensitivity is causing customers to switch providers. My task was to explore the data, develop hypotheses, and build predictive models to understand the drivers of churn.

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Predictive modeling using Python  
- Strategic insight generation  
- Business problem framing through a data science lens

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
